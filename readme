Encryptor/Decryptor/Breaker of Vigenere cipher

usage:
	python3 main.py [mode] (files)

Always saves the output in the out/ folder.

[mode]:
	encrypt (path/to/key) (path/to/plain)
		Encrypts a specific file
		Saves the file in the in the out/ folder, with the same name as the plain except it's extension is now ".crypto"

	decrypt (path/to/key) (path/to/crypto)
		Decrypts a file 
		Saves the file in the out/ folder, with the same name as the crypto except it's extension is now ".plain"

	break [-kN] (path/to/crypto) [(path/to/crypto),...]
		Tries to break the cipher
		Saves the file in the out/ folder, with the same name as the crypto except it now has ".break" as extension.
		The "-k" flag can be used before the path, this will set a new maximum checked length for the key.
		If more crypto files follow the first, they are all assumed to have the same key as the first, and they will collectivly be analysed to create one key.
		The output file will have 2 lines. On the first line, it puts whatever it thinks that the key is. On the second line, it puts the decrypted cyphertext.

Examples:
	python3 main.py encrypt in/vig_group13.key in/vig_group13.plain
		encrypts the contents of file "in/vig_group13.plain" and saves the result in "./out/vig_group13.crypto" 

	python3 main.py decrypt in/vig_group13.key in/vig_group13.crypto
		decrypts the contents of the file "in/vig_group13.crypto" and saves the result in "./out/vig_group13.plain"

	python3 main.py break in/vig_group13.crypto
		Tries to break the contents of file "in/vig_group13.crypto" and saves the result in "./out/vig_group13.break"

	python3 main.py break -k210 Ciphers/text*.crypto
		Tries to break the contents of file 
				"Ciphers/text1.crypto", "Ciphers/text2.crypto",
				"Ciphers/text3.crypto", "Ciphers/text4.crypto",
				"Ciphers/text5.crypto" 
			and saves the result in "./out/textN.break" (replace N with the corisponding number)


Benchmarking:
	there is also a bash script, ./timetest.sh, runs the linux "time" command on every file in Ciphers, and outputs the contents in "out/time.txt". It is only made to support the current files in Ciphers
