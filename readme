Encryptor/Decryptor/Breaker of Vigenere cipher

usage:
	python3 main.py [mode] (files)

Always saves the output in the out/ folder.

[mode]:
	encrypt (path/to/key) (path/to/plain)
		Encrypts a specific file
		Saves the file in the in the out/ folder, with the same name as the plain except it's extension is now ".crypto"

	decrypt (path/to/key) (path/to/crypto)
		Decrypts a file 
		Saves the file in the out/ folder, with the same name as the crypto except it's extension is now ".plain"

	break (path/to/crypto)
		Tries to break the cipher
		Saves the file in the out/ folder, with the same name as the crypto except it now has ".break" as extension.
		The file will have 2 lines. On the first line, it puts whatever it thinks that the key is. On the second line, it puts the decrypted cyphertext.

Examples:
	python3 main.py encrypt in/vig_group13.key in/vig_group13.plain
		encrypts the contents of file "in/vig_group13.plain" and saves the result in "./out/vig_group13.crypto" 

	python3 main.py decrypt in/vig_group13.key in/vig_group13.crypto
		decrypts the contents of the file "in/vig_group13.crypto" and saves the result in "./out/vig_group13.plain"

	python3 main.py break in/vig_group13.crypto
		Tries to break the contents of file "in/vig_group13.crypto" and saves the result in "./out/vig_group13.break"
