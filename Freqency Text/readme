This folder contains 3 things and a lot of temporary files.
	* The book "RÃ¶da rummet"
	* python files to generate a frequency table from the book, saved in freq.json
	* freq.json The Frequency table used in the big cipher breaking program.

Nothing in this file needs to be runned, and should be left untouched. If you want to genererate another freq.json, run "python3 html-txt.py" and "python3 freq_gen.py", in that order.
